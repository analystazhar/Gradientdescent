## Introduction

This README file provides an overview of Gradient Descent, a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning and deep learning. Gradient Descent is used to minimize a cost or loss function and find the optimal set of parameters for a model.

## Basic Concept

Gradient Descent involves iteratively adjusting model parameters based on the gradient (derivative) of a cost function with respect to those parameters. The goal is to move in the direction of the steepest decrease in the cost function to reach the minimum.

## Algorithm

The core steps of the Gradient Descent algorithm include:

1. Initialize model parameters.
2. Define a cost function to measure the error.
3. Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.
4. Update parameters using the gradient and a learning rate.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a stopping criterion is met.

## Types of Gradient Descent

There are several variants of Gradient Descent, including:
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Computes the gradient using the entire dataset.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Computes the gradient using one random data point at a time.
- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Computes the gradient using a small random batch of data.
- **Momentum Gradient Descent**: Adds momentum to the parameter updates.
- **Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adam**: Adaptive learning rate methods.

## Hyperparameters

Key hyperparameters to tune when using Gradient Descent include the learning rate, batch size (for mini-batch), and the choice of the specific variant (e.g., SGD, Adam). Proper tuning is crucial for efficient convergence.

## Implementation

To implement Gradient Descent in your machine learning or deep learning project, you typically need to:

- Define a cost function relevant to your problem.
- Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model's parameters.
- Implement the parameter update rule.
- Choose appropriate hyperparameters.
- Monitor the convergence of the cost function during training.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Experiment with different learning rates to find the one that works best for your problem.
- Visualize the cost function over iterations to ensure convergence.
- Normalize or standardize your input data for better convergence.
- Consider using a variant of Gradient Descent tailored to your problem.
